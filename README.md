# Exo-Sieve: An AI Pipeline for Exoplanet Discovery ü™ê

A two-stage deep learning pipeline built for the **NASA Space Apps 2025 Challenge** ("A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI") to discover and classify exoplanets from raw light curve data.

## \#\# The Problem üåå

Manually sifting through massive astronomical datasets from missions like Kepler and TESS is a significant bottleneck in exoplanet discovery. While traditional algorithms can find signals that match known patterns, they may miss novel or unexpected phenomena.

-----

## \#\# Our Solution: The Intelligent Triage Pipeline üß†

Exo-Sieve is an automated system that mimics a scientific discovery workflow. It first identifies any signal of interest and then diagnoses what it is, creating a highly efficient and powerful analysis tool.

### \#\#\# Stage 1: Unsupervised Sieve

The pipeline's first stage uses an **Autoencoder** neural network. Trained on a vast dataset of "normal" or uninteresting stellar light curves, this model learns to compress and reconstruct them accurately. When it encounters a new, anomalous signal‚Äîlike a potential exoplanet transit‚Äîit fails to reconstruct it properly. This high **reconstruction error** flags the signal as scientifically interesting.

### \#\#\# Stage 2: Expert Classifier

Signals flagged by the Sieve are immediately passed to a specialized **1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. This expert model, trained on a curated dataset of confirmed exoplanets, eclipsing binaries, and other phenomena, performs a definitive classification. It provides a clear identification of the signal (e.g., "Exoplanet Transit") along with a confidence score.

## \#\# Getting Started üöÄ

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### \#\#\# Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8+
  * pip package manager

### \#\#\# Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/exo-sieve.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd exo-sieve
    ```
3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: You may also need to download the trained model files. [Add link to model files if they are not in the repo].*

### \#\#\# Running the Application

1.  **Start the Flask server:**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
2.  **Open your browser** and navigate to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```

### \#\#\# Usage

Once the application is running, upload a `.csv` file containing light curve data with two columns: `time` and `flux`. Click the "Analyze" button to see the two-stage analysis results.
